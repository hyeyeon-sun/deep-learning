This repository contains what I have studied about deep learning.

It can be divided into two parts: 
the first is to take and review a deep learning course for all,
and the second is to analyze arbitrary list dataset based on the course.





1. deep learning for all lecture review

I've posted the contents of a deep learning course for everyone on my blog and put the source codes here.
To see a specific description,
Please refer to this page(https://jumpjump3030.tistory.com/)





2. deep learning projects

 - fasion mnist project : Dress was classified using softmax classification. 
 It has classified 784 kinds of clothes into 6 types, 
 and will introduce various methods such as data preprocessing and dropout in the future.
 
 - iris classification project : Various kinds of iris were classified using softmax classification.
 Only the first item was properly classified and the accuracy hovered around 50%,
 but the accuracy of 87% was obtained by modifying the learning-rate from 0.01 to 0.1.
